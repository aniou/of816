# Nein816

This is a port to Lenore Byron's [Neon816](https://hackaday.io/project/164325-neon816)
system.  To build it, change to the platform directory and run
build.sh.  Right now, this does not produce a working Forth because I don't know
how to interact with the hardware just yet. That being siad, it  will
output a binary named "forth" that isn't suitable for anything, just yet.

Details about how to buld it for RAM/ROM/whatnot will be forthcoming.

## Port Features

Hopefully this section will be filled up with stuff that works like Lenore's
Forth.  See the [Neon816 Manual](https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1643257030480800/sysmanual.pdf)
